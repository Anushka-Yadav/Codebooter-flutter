## Code Examples

Include code examples to illustrate best practices and common tasks.
Best Practices Example
Naming Conventions for Variables
// Good variable naming conventions
String userName = 'JohnDoe';
int age = 25;
bool isLoggedIn = true;

Common Task Example
Making an API Request using the http Package
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchData() async {
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data'));
  
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    print('Data: ${response.body}');
    // Handle the received data
  } else {
    print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
    // Handle error
  }
}
Explanation: Fetching data from an API using the http package, and handling the response based on its status code.

State Management Best Practice
Using Provider Package for State Management

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

class Counter with ChangeNotifier {
  int _count = 0;

  int get count => _count;

  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => Counter(),
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter App')),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              Text('You have pushed the button this many times:'),
              Consumer<Counter>(
                builder: (context, counter, child) {
                  return Text(
                    '${counter.count}',
                    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Provider.of<Counter>(context, listen: false).increment();
          },
          tooltip: 'Increment',
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

Explanation: Demonstrating the use of the provider package for simple state management, allowing widget rebuilds on state changes.
